            <h1>SPRINT 1</h1>
            <img src="images/sprint1/IMG_6968.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>As a starting point, my group chose the Seestücke series, precisely number 3 out of 20, by Anton Bruhin
                from 2001. He made them with Microsoft Word Draw and then printed them with a laser printer. This series
                was interesting to me because, at first glance, a few of the shapes constituting these landscapes seem
                quite simple. In spite of this, the artist manages to find an interesting way to play with the
                figurative and the abstract whilst revisiting the concept of the classical seascape painting. This was
                one of the main reasons why I picked this particular image, because the duality between figurative and
                abstract has an important role in my artistic practice, on top of working with series and randomness but
                in an analogue way. The latter also contributed to my choice because graphic art also first started in
                an analogue way before the arrival of computers.
                Through re-coding, I learnt that these shapes involve much more work than I had imagined, considering
                how much I struggled to reach a similar ellipse shape. I would say I have found a new sense of respect
                for graphic works, whether they are produced digitally or in an analogue wayanalogously. I now realise
                that thinking “How hard can it be?”, just because Anton Bruhin used Microsoft Word Draw, was quite naïve
                of me. This showed me how little knowledge is taught to us when it comes to using digital tools, in the
                sense that we know how to use them but we do not understand, or actually know, how they really work.
                Small reality check when it comes to knowledge gate-keeping.
                Furthermore, coming from a Fine Arts background, the term “graphic” often carries a negative
                connotation, because it can be perceived as lacking depth. Even though I never personally experienced
                this comment, the re-coding process has now opened a new door of possibilities and a new perspective on
                my own artistic practice and on digital forms of art because I can link it to my personal experience; it
                has become more tangible. Also, I now see that the topic of digital forms of art was never addressed in
                my art history classes and that this most likely contributed to this distance I used to feel towards it.

           <h1>SPRINT 2</h1>
           <img src="images/sprint2/grass.png" alt="">
           <p>For Sprint 2, my group decided that we wanted to create a web extension that forces you take a break in two different ways: either the website falls apart or an image and some text appear resembling a meme( this idea came from thinking of memes that say “Have you touched grass today?). I decided to go for the second option because it felt easier to code for me. My idea was that by at some point clicking on the screen, an image of grass would appear with the question “Have you touched grass today?” and then later on, I also decided that I wanted to add a yes-button and a no-button. I imagined that those buttons could also the be interactive and lead a new page, but the content of that still has to be determined. So far, I managed to get the buttons to appear with the image and the text but as soon as I started trying out with the interactive part, my code did not work anymore. This sort of thing, the code not working when something new is added, happened nearly every time during the coding process; it was very much struggle. 
            What worked for me was much better than the web extension part was experimenting with the html and CSS code to make a web page. It felt more intuitive and I really liked the trashy and collaged aesthetic of it. I feel it also makes more sense to me in connection with my artistic practice because I like to work in a repetitive way with a form of collaging. In that sense, the next time I would stick more to what I find playful and fun instead of wanting to try everything out, which in this case became more of a constant frustration because it was a lot of new things at the same time. Maybe one idea could have been creating a web page that then in the end is somehow connected to the web extension.

            <img src="images/sprint3/baby1.png" alt="">
            <p>This project, GARY - tries to handle, is based on the two first versions of these digital collages, ON N’AIME PAS LES TÊTE QUI DéPASSENT (2024) and GARY – handle with care (2025). Over time, these creatures have broadened themselves from being the ultimate representation for the “weirdo” to being carer for one’s inner weirdo. 
                The GARY series is about caring for and embracing your inner weirdo. In my practice, it is also your inner child because it is a part of oneself that has the possibility to remain free of conforming to society’s expectations. GARY takes the appearance of a monster-like creature, representing the ultimate state of the weirdo. Weirdo exists because on the opposite side of this spectrum of weirdness there is what is called “normal”, born from societal expectations. They both depend on each other in order to exist. 
                Keeping this setting in mind, my idea was to try out new ways to show this work since I haven’t really found one that satisfies me. The goal was to glitch GARY because, as I have recently read in Glitch Feminism by Legacy Russell( they/them ), the glitch is the error, the mistake, the non-conforming, the digital weirdo. So in other words, I wanted to make the digital collage of GARY a weirdo in both its layers: the visual and the digital. 
                I started by creating a sort of blog-page for GARY and wanted to play around with the different elements of it like the scrollbar or the cursor. The idea was that the page would be very long, then forcing the user to scroll for a long time. And as they scrolled lower and lower, the page would become more and more glitchy. Because of the scale of work involved in this idea, I decided to experiment with the glitch effect, animations and re-drawing of the collages on a smaller scale.
